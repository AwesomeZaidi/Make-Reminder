# MakeUtility Project

Weather is a Golang Slackbot that can give you the weather of any city you'd like to know. All you have to do is just ask it 😄 🌤

## Proposal Description

Sometimes, when I'm on Slack messaging a friend about  my trip back home, I just want to know what the weather will be. I wish there was a Slack Bot I could just ask for the weather in any city. Golang is a great technology to use when building a Slackbot because the concurrency in the calls I make if thousands of people start using the Utility, it's a fast backend that will allow the user to get back the weather super fast and easy.

## Project Guidelines

1. **Must score higher than `80%` to pass the project**.
2.  **Consult the [syllabus](../README.md)** for **project due dates** and rules surrounding the **total number and velocity of commits** in projects and assignments.
3.  **Copy this document** and commit it to your project's repository.
    1.  **Use the ✅ column to keep track of requirements you've completed** so far.
    2.  **✅ each section** of the rubric **upon completion** to keep track of your score.
    3.  **This technique will ensure delivery of a passing, portfolio-worthy project**.
4. Items **marked with 🌟** will earn you **bonus points**.
   1. You may **choose to complete any, all, or none** of the **bonus challenges**.
   2. Projects **scoring `>95%`** will **earn a limited-edition holographic [droxey](https://github.com/droxey) sticker** at the end of the term!
5. Instructor **feedback will appear in the empty space below** the rubric and **distributed at the end of the term**.
